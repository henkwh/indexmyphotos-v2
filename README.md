# indexmyphotos.v2
assigns tags, dates and location data to photos. Second version made with WPF, containing MVVM pattern.
For the first version go to 'https://github.com/henkwh/indexmyphotos'

## Getting started

Just Drag and Drop your image file into the program. It will create a local copy in the program files folder and manage any files completely self-sufficient within a database.

## Motivation

My search for any offline-service that is capable of managing my photos and showing their location on a map was badly disappointing.
And because I've got tons of Fotos from family, travels, sport, etc. by now, a program to manage my fotos was very needful.

## Synopsis

The Visual Studio Project "Index my Photos" offers a functionality to assign tags, dates, descriptions and location data to Image files (.png, .jpg files at the moment).<br/>

## Prerequisites

Software required:
- MS Visual Studio
- .NET Framework v4.6.1
